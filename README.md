Hi!
This is a test task for a company HexOcean.
1. On the first day, planning the execution of the task, 1.5h,
2. On the second day, the form was drawn, 4h.
3. On the third day, I worked with the logic of the form's behavior, 4h.
4. On the fourth day, I worked with the design and sending a request to the server, 4h // Most likely the server is down.
